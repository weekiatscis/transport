The file /singapore-journey-planner/singapore-journey-planner/public/favicon.ico is typically a binary file (an icon file) and cannot be represented as text. You will need to create or obtain a favicon image file and place it in the specified directory.

If you have a favicon image, you can simply save it as `favicon.ico` in the `public` directory. If you need a placeholder, you can create a simple favicon using an online favicon generator or design one using graphic design software.

If you need further assistance with creating or obtaining a favicon, please let me know!
